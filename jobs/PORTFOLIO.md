## Portfolio ideas

1. A CRUD web application: A basic form of a CRUD application is a To-Do List or a Notes webpage. Having one of these projects on your website shows your skill with manipulating data structures. It's also a good opportunity to display your work with a frontend framework - Tania Rascia's article on working with local storage is a helpful introduction to learning how to create CRUD web applications with vanilla JavaScript: https://www.taniarascia.com/how-to-use-local-storage-with-javascript/ (move to JS file)| https://www.taniarascia.com/crud-app-in-react-with-hooks/ | it's a good idea to build them using a framework such as React
2. An API-connected website - APIs allow frontend developers to collect, modify and delete data from a backend database. Building a site that consumes an API to display data is a great project to include on your portfolio – weather app: https://webdesign.tutsplus.com/tutorials/build-a-simple-weather-app-with-vanilla-javascript--cms-33893 |
3. deploy & manage a website or small web app | examples: crime alert app, review app like imdb, notes app, to-do app, chat app, movie / lyrics search app, weather app, beat maker, js clock, weight, / measurement / money conversion tool, shopping cart, dashboards

## Advanced Front-End Developer aspects

The following are not as easy but look great is you can implement them.

### Front-end JavaScript frameworks

- allow you to have intricate user interfaces which would be harder and take more time with vanilla JS. You can use any framework on the front end with any language on the server – `Vue.js` is a bit easier to learn than `React`

### Testing and Debugging

Testing is a big part of the front end development process and there are frameworks to help you. Programs like Mocha and Jasmine are designed to speed up and simplify your testing process. There are testing frameworks for diff languages:

- Unit tests: units like Fx's and classes
- Integration tests: modules tested as a group > end-to-end tests: test workflow from start to finish
- There are different testing methods in web development, such as functional testing that emphasizes a particular piece of functionality on your site, or unit testing that consists of testing the smallest bit of code that is making something fail in your site
- You must possess the skill and ability to test and debug codes. There are different testing methods for web development.
  - Functional testing looks at a particular piece of functionality on your site and ensures it does everything according to the code
  - Unit testing is another method that tests the smallest bit of code and examines it individually for correct operation.
- Testing and Debugging are extremely important for delivering a positive user experience - know how to check for JavaScript errors and debug code. You should learn how to perform effective `cross-browser compatibility testing`
- **DevTools**: Browser Developer Tools - modern web browsers come equipped with developer tools for testing and debugging. These tools allow you to test the web pages in the browser itself and finds out how the page is interpreting the code
- Browser developer tools usually consist of an inspector and a JavaScript console.
  - The inspector allows you to see what the runtime HTML on your page looks like, what CSS is associated with each element on the page, and also allows you to edit your HTML and CSS and see the changes live as they happen.
  - The JS console allows you to view any errors that occur as the browser tries to execute your JS code

### JAMstack

- Static Site Generators – generate your pages at build-time as opposed to real-time, making them super fat and secure
  - Gatsby (React based), - you can still have a dynamic site and work with data
  - Gatsby: dynamic and uses GraphQL and can use a headless CMS
- Headless CMS: like WordPress, Druple are backend only content mgmt system that is commonly used w\ static site generators, meaning you can create ontent w\o touching any code – a headless cms works in the same way but it doesn't have that front-facing web page – it's used strictly for the data part and you can add whatever you want for the front end –
- a popular option is to use Gatsy and connect it to a headless cms to get your content – he prefers Strapi – it's an open-source node.js headless cms that you host yourself – WordPress is another option b\c it has a REST API built into it and Sanito.io is also great
- JAMSTACK: the last few technologies can fit into what is known as the jamstack – a web architecture with high performance, security & scalability at a low cost w\ a great dev experience – Jamstack stands for Javascript, APIs and Markup → static sites / assets, markdown, serverless, headless cms for content, hosting w\ services like Netlify and AWS
- JAMstack: Entire project served on a CDN | Everything lives in Git | Automated builds | Atomic deploys | Instant cache invalidation

### Web Performance

- web performance - defines the amount of time it takes for your site to load - there are steps you can take to improve performance times such as optimizing images and minifying CSS and JavaScript - Programs like Grunt and gulp can be used to automate image optimization, CSS and JS minifying, and other web performance chores
- web performance - refers to the speed of a website - Sometimes this is done by minifying CSS and JavaScript; other times, it depends on the type of images you use. There are thousands of reasons why your website is slow, and talented front-end developers can fix these issues
- Web Performance Optimization (WPO) - is the process of increasing the speed of a website - Faster downloads can improve visitor retention rates and ultimately provide a better user experience. This is especially true on mobile devices or when the user has a slow internet connection. Programs like Grunt and Gulp provide automated image optimization, tweak your CSS and JavaScript code, and perform many other web performance optimization tasks

### CSS Preprocessing

- css preprocessing - CSS Preprocessor is an advanced version of CSS. This is used to enhance the primary class of CSS to create better versions of websites.
- It is not just a language to improve the styling elements, but it helps the developers to skip tasks like writing CSS selectors and color strings frequently - There are three types of preprocessors available such as Sass, LESS and Stylus

### Command Line

- command line - Although the majority of your work is done through a GUI, you can add serious cred to your front end skills if you have a mastery of the command line

## Graphic Design

- graphic design - Displaying unique and bold graphics can help you achieve this. Figma, Photoshop, InVision, and Sketch are common design packages used by front-end developers
- responsive design - allow the layout and design of a site to change depending on the type of device accessing it

### SEO

- Search Engine Optimization (SEO) - is the process of making sure a site is accessible by search bots and optimizing its ranking in search results
- as a front-end developer, it doesn't hurt to learn the basics. You'll be mostly concerned with on-page SEO. This includes various design features you can build into sites to help them get discovered by Google and Yahoo.
- Internal linking structures, breadcrumb navigation, and the use of friendly URLs are all examples of on-page SEO concepts

### Miscellaneous

- Progressive web apps (PWA):

building-an-effective-dev-portfolio.pdf:

- pg 15: They want to know if you’ll be 1) easy to mentor, 2) if you have the grit to work through tough problems, and 3) the humility to admit when you don’t know something.
- 9g 18: opportunities to convey the stuff employers care about: 1) competence, 2) enthusiasm, 3) fit, and 4) personality.

Jr Dev:

1. not the whole tech stack, but build something by taking a deep-dive into HTML (Aria roles / attributes), CSS (s\s BTN hover/focus. Kybrd bindings), or JavaScript (anything s\a promises, CBs, this) –
2. kinds of projects: solves a problem that you are currently having (pre/code tag formatting) – or showcases your interests, or your problem-solving ability – a chrome extension, a web scraper, a custom API that you wished ws on the web – it’s something that you are building for yourself –
3. do you need a JS framework to stand out: NO, but it helps –
4. ALGORITHMS: you will need them for interviews –
5. 3 JS interview Q’s: a) expand on your own code (2nd time he mentioned promise and API), b) talk about what you made with JS, c) … -
6. 5+ yrs of experience: if it ays “entry-level”, disregard all that –
7. how to know if our JS is good enough for a jr dev role: scanning code and understand at a high level what is happening – understand someonebody’s js code – know how to interact with Web APIS – fetching data from an API -

Portfolio – excellent example: Julia Johnson: https://www.juliacodes.com/ | Brittany Chiang: https://brittanychiang.com/ |

- Page for each project listing JULIA → 1) intro paragraph, 2) goal and purpose for the project, 3) web stack and why, 4) screenshots, 5) problems & thought process, 6) lessons learned || BRITTANY → 1)
- PORTFOLIO:
- HAVE A GOOD README WITH: 1) the technologies used and 2) HOW the pcs of the app fit together, 3) the features you have/added, and 4) how other people can run the project -
- TIP 1 - make it full-stack: if you want a full-stack job but it could help - you will be a better front end dev by understanding what goes into back end dev -
- TIP 2: put effort into the design: make it look prety - there is a bias on whether or not your live demo looks good -
- TIP 3: have your project solve a real world problem – TIP 4: MAKE A CRUD PROJECT!!! Job Board, blog post, etc – TIP 5: A project with automatic testing (Cypress) – test status codes – TIP 6: GitHub actions with a simple YAML file – ALWAYS DEPLOY! And use a GitHub action to do that – (on ci and cd???) -

ABOUT SECTION:

- pg 19: good example → have anecdotes
- It should sound like something you might say in real life
- ...very unusual thing to spot on a portfolio site! They start reading from the beginning, and they get hooked in

PROJECT SECTION:

- pg 22: Have you tested your site on the browser and/or device the visitor is using and have you found and fixed all possible edge-case bugs?
- Why is this project important to you? What inspired it? Why did you choose to build this? What are the major features that make it unique? How does it compare to existing products like it? What did you start with? Was this built from scratch? What was the hardest part of building this product? Where did you get stuck along the way? When you did get stuck, how did you resolve it? How did you overcome the obstacles you faced? What did you learn from doing this project? How has it affected the work you’ve done since then?
- We want to tell a story about how a project came to be. It’s much more interesting than showing a final product, without context. It also sends a much stronger signal to employers about what you can do!
- the About Me section and the Projects section should have an element of storytelling - we want to share some history of how we got here

THINGS TO AVOID:

- No skill charts, “What I Do” section, Bravado,
- the what I do section, my website: this sends a confusing message to prospective employers. it’s a positioning problem; It makes it seem like you’re not looking for full-time employment

DESIGN:

- pg 40: it needs to look reasonably well-designed - Users are more forgiving of a website with usability problems if it looks pretty
- Software development is all about how something works, not how something looks. The unfortunate reality is that people might judge our softwaredevelopment skills based on how aesthetic our portfolios site is. Having a nice design can subconsciously suggest that we know how to build good software
- pg 41: The easiest approach is to copy existing designs - You should always credit the sources that you take inspiration from, unless the inspiration is so subtle that nobody would be able to tell: https://www.kaystocks.com/ |

- BLOG POSTS SECTION!

FRAMEWORKS & TOOLING:
HOSTING:
PERSONALIZING YOUR PORTFOLIO:

- pg 45: Your biggest lever for customizing Your portfolio will be in the copy - how we describe ourselves and our projects – animations, options, hover effects, etc - Small, creative details that reflect your personality can go a long way towards making your portfolio stand out and be memorable.

ACCESSIBILITY:
GENERAL LAYOUT:

- pg 48: "MUST-HAVES": 1) brief "About Me", 2) grid or cards of projects, 3) Contact info, 4) photo, 5) each project linking to a "Project Details" page

PROJECT DETAILS:

- pg 48: Adding “project detail” pages is pretty uncommon among developer portfolios, but it’s super common among design portfolios...screenshots alone are insufficient. They need to tell a story about their work, to capture all the stuff not shown in the images. If you only take one thing from this book, make it this: no matter how cool your project is, it cannot be summarized by a screenshot and a short paragraph - highlight all of the details that make our project cool - Things that might seem trivial or mundane to you can actually be very impressive to potential employers!
- High-level summary of what the project is
- List of core functionalities / interesting features
- Your role -
- technologies used
- Links to live demo + source code

Purpose and Goal:

- Why did you build this project? Why is it important to you?
- What was the expected outcome of the project?
- What were the initial designs?
- Any other preliminary planning that you did which helps build a narrative
- What feature does it have that took the most work, or was the most technically impressive?
- What were the technical hurdles that got in your way? Any major problems you hit during development?
- How did you solve those problems? What was the solution? Go deep here, and write with a developer in mind.
- LESSONS LEARNED: What did you learn? Technical, management, … avoid long paragraphs. Make use of many headings, and use lists - make it easy to skim

NETWORKING: Dev Networking:
It’s estimated that between 70-80% of jobs are never advertised on job boards!

- Pin your portfolio site on your Github profile.
- Add your portfolio site to your social media profiles
