## Portfolio ideas

1. A CRUD web application: A basic form of a CRUD application is a To-Do List or a Notes webpage. Having one of these projects on your website shows your skill with manipulating data structures. It's also a good opportunity to display your work with a frontend framework - Tania Rascia's article on working with local storage is a helpful introduction to learning how to create CRUD web applications with vanilla JavaScript: https://www.taniarascia.com/how-to-use-local-storage-with-javascript/ (move to JS file)| https://www.taniarascia.com/crud-app-in-react-with-hooks/ | it's a good idea to build them using a framework such as React
2. An API-connected website - APIs allow frontend developers to collect, modify and delete data from a backend database. Building a site that consumes an API to display data is a great project to include on your portfolio – weather app: https://webdesign.tutsplus.com/tutorials/build-a-simple-weather-app-with-vanilla-javascript--cms-33893 |
3. deploy & manage a website or small web app | examples: crime alert app, review app like imdb, notes app, to-do app, chat app, movie / lyrics search app, weather app, beat maker, js clock, weight, / measurement / money conversion tool, shopping cart, dashboards

## Advanced Front-End Developer aspects

The following are not as easy but look great is you can implement them.

### Front-end JavaScript frameworks

- allow you to have intricate user interfaces which would be harder and take more time with vanilla JS. You can use any framework on the front end with any language on the server – `Vue.js` is a bit easier to learn than `React`

### Testing and Debugging

Testing is a big part of the front end development process and there are frameworks to help you. Programs like Mocha and Jasmine are designed to speed up and simplify your testing process. There are testing frameworks for diff languages:

- Unit tests: units like Fx's and classes
- Integration tests: modules tested as a group > end-to-end tests: test workflow from start to finish
- There are different testing methods in web development, such as functional testing that emphasizes a particular piece of functionality on your site, or unit testing that consists of testing the smallest bit of code that is making something fail in your site
- You must possess the skill and ability to test and debug codes. There are different testing methods for web development.
  - Functional testing looks at a particular piece of functionality on your site and ensures it does everything according to the code
  - Unit testing is another method that tests the smallest bit of code and examines it individually for correct operation.
- Testing and Debugging are extremely important for delivering a positive user experience - know how to check for JavaScript errors and debug code. You should learn how to perform effective `cross-browser compatibility testing`
- **DevTools**: Browser Developer Tools - modern web browsers come equipped with developer tools for testing and debugging. These tools allow you to test the web pages in the browser itself and finds out how the page is interpreting the code
- Browser developer tools usually consist of an inspector and a JavaScript console.
  - The inspector allows you to see what the runtime HTML on your page looks like, what CSS is associated with each element on the page, and also allows you to edit your HTML and CSS and see the changes live as they happen.
  - The JS console allows you to view any errors that occur as the browser tries to execute your JS code

### JAMstack

- Static Site Generators – generate your pages at build-time as opposed to real-time, making them super fat and secure
  - Gatsby (React based), - you can still have a dynamic site and work with data
  - Gatsby: dynamic and uses GraphQL and can use a headless CMS
- Headless CMS: like WordPress, Druple are backend only content mgmt system that is commonly used w\ static site generators, meaning you can create ontent w\o touching any code – a headless cms works in the same way but it doesn't have that front-facing web page – it's used strictly for the data part and you can add whatever you want for the front end –
- a popular option is to use Gatsy and connect it to a headless cms to get your content – he prefers Strapi – it's an open-source node.js headless cms that you host yourself – WordPress is another option b\c it has a REST API built into it and Sanito.io is also great
- JAMSTACK: the last few technologies can fit into what is known as the jamstack – a web architecture with high performance, security & scalability at a low cost w\ a great dev experience – Jamstack stands for Javascript, APIs and Markup → static sites / assets, markdown, serverless, headless cms for content, hosting w\ services like Netlify and AWS
- JAMstack: Entire project served on a CDN | Everything lives in Git | Automated builds | Atomic deploys | Instant cache invalidation

### Web Performance

- web performance - defines the amount of time it takes for your site to load - there are steps you can take to improve performance times such as optimizing images and minifying CSS and JavaScript - Programs like Grunt and gulp can be used to automate image optimization, CSS and JS minifying, and other web performance chores
- web performance - refers to the speed of a website - Sometimes this is done by minifying CSS and JavaScript; other times, it depends on the type of images you use. There are thousands of reasons why your website is slow, and talented front-end developers can fix these issues
- Web Performance Optimization (WPO) - is the process of increasing the speed of a website - Faster downloads can improve visitor retention rates and ultimately provide a better user experience. This is especially true on mobile devices or when the user has a slow internet connection. Programs like Grunt and Gulp provide automated image optimization, tweak your CSS and JavaScript code, and perform many other web performance optimization tasks

### CSS Preprocessing

- css preprocessing - CSS Preprocessor is an advanced version of CSS. This is used to enhance the primary class of CSS to create better versions of websites.
- It is not just a language to improve the styling elements, but it helps the developers to skip tasks like writing CSS selectors and color strings frequently - There are three types of preprocessors available such as Sass, LESS and Stylus

### Command Line

- command line - Although the majority of your work is done through a GUI, you can add serious cred to your front end skills if you have a mastery of the command line

## Graphic Design

- graphic design - Displaying unique and bold graphics can help you achieve this. Figma, Photoshop, InVision, and Sketch are common design packages used by front-end developers
- responsive design - allow the layout and design of a site to change depending on the type of device accessing it

### SEO

- Search Engine Optimization (SEO) - is the process of making sure a site is accessible by search bots and optimizing its ranking in search results
- as a front-end developer, it doesn't hurt to learn the basics. You'll be mostly concerned with on-page SEO. This includes various design features you can build into sites to help them get discovered by Google and Yahoo.
- Internal linking structures, breadcrumb navigation, and the use of friendly URLs are all examples of on-page SEO concepts

### Miscellaneous

- Progressive web apps (PWA):
- GraphQL:
