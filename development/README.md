JavaScript naming conventions:

• Variable and function names written as camelCase
• Global variables written in UPPERCASE (We don't, but it's quite common)
• Constants (like PI) written in UPPERCASE
• Many programmers prefer to use underscores (date_of_birth), especially in SQL databases.
◦ Underscores are often used in PHP documentation
• Booleans: use is, are, has: isColor = true, hasSomething = false, …
• A variable name should describe the entity the variable represents.
• When writing your code, prioritize ease of reading over speed of writing.
• Use consistent standards throughout a project to minimize the cognitive burden of small decisions.
