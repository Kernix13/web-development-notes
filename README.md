## Learning

The courses I've taken, are taking, or am considering taking.

1. The Odin Project: You can not use a Windows machine unless you have an Ubuntu/Windows Dual-Boot set up on your PC.
1. Scrimba: I took a Kevin Powell course and it was good - look into it.

### freeCodeCamp

I am losing faith in freeCodeCamp

- Responsive Web Design: They definitely cover some topics, techniques, tags amd attributes that were new to me but there are problems with it. They rely heavily on absolute and relative positioning of a ton of `<div>` tags. They rarely use Ems or REMS and instead use pixels which is not _responsive_.
- JavaScript Data Structures and Algorithms: This is pretty good but it is lacking in certain areas like Promises in the ES6 section. The final projects are easier than the Intermediate Algorithms section, and they really don't cover and explain Functional Programming good enough IMO.
- The Front End Devleopment Libraries is a total mess - don't bother!
- and I'll skip other things

I'm going to look into the following courses they offer:

1. Relational Databases
1. Quality Assurance
1. Information Security

I also will be trying the problems in [Coding Interview Prep](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/coding-interview-prep/). The final section is called Project Euler with 480 JavaScript problems.
